# Simulation-and-Modelling-of-Solar-Power-Generator

●	A solar generator works by collecting solar energy through solar panels and then storing that energy into its built-in solar battery.
<br>●	An inverter connected to it, converts the collected energy (DC) into alternating current (AC) before used in home appliances.
